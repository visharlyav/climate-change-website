<p>The aim of this website is to educate reader on the many harmful impacts of climate change, whether they be direct or indirect, and what can be done to prevent climate change.</p>
<p>Definition of climate change: According to the Oxford dictionary, climate change is “a change in global or regional climate patterns, in particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onwards and attributed largely to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced using fossil fuels.”</p>

<h4>Causes of climate change:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Deforestation: Deforestation is the purposeful cleaning of forest land. This man-made procedure is done in order to create space for agriculture and livestock, harvest wood as a source of fuel and mining minerals. Deforestation leads to increased C02 emissions due to the loss of trees. It also demolishes the habitats of animals making them endangered and having to adapt to new habitats. Moreover, forest fires become more likely to happen due to the decreased humidity levels, drying out the forest. </li>
    <li>Burning coal, gas, oil: At the moment, coal is the single biggest contributor to climate change. </li>
    <li>Increasing livestock farming: Meat production contributes to 18-25% of all greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon dioxide is the main GHG emitted from animal farming through deforestation for grazing and land use. Nitrous oxide from manure and slurry and methane from animal's digestive system are also large contributors to greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
    <li>Nitrogenous fertilisers: Nitrogen fertilisers are sprayed over crops so that more food is produced quickly. Nitrogen emission primarily come from agriculture, especially due to the increased demand for crops. N20 is approximately 300 times more potent than C02 and it is currently the third biggest contributor to climate change.</li>
    <li>Fluorinated gases: Fluorinated gases are a group of human made gases used in various industrial applications. They are very powerful greenhouse gases and is 23 000 times more potent than the effect of carbon dioxide. Fluorinated gases are used instead of ozone depleting substances but they have a much larger global warming effect.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Direct impacts of climate change:</h4>
<img src="surfacetemp.jpeg" alt="TemperatureGraph" style="width:50%">
<ul>
    <li>Temperatures rising: The temperature of the Earth has increased by 0.08 degrees Celsius each decade since 1880. Moreover, the rate of global warming over the last 40 years is 0.18 degrees Celsius per decade. This implies that the problem of climate change is getting worse as time goes on. </li>
    <li>Sea levels rise: Sea levels have increased by 8-9 inches since 1880. The global sea level reached a new high at 3.6 inches abouve 1993 levels.</li>
    <li>Shrinking glaciers: Most glaciers are shrinking and this is the biggest causes of sea level rise in the last few decades. Almost 25 meters of liquid water equivalent of ice has veen lost since 1970. Shrinking glaicers is also a threat to natural and human water supplies across the world.  </li>
    <li>Higher ocean temperature: Excess heat from greenhouse gas emissions are absorbed by the ocean, which results in rising ocean temperatures. The temperature has risen an at average rate of 0.14 degrees Farenheit per decade from 1901 to 2020.</li>
    <li>Increase in heavy precipitation: Warmer air the more water vapour it can hold. For every degree the temperature of the air increases by, the air can hold 7% more water vapour. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Indirect impacts of climate change:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Loss of biodiversity: Deforestation and increase in ocean temperatures has meant that the habitat of animals are threatened. </li>
    <li>Increase in hunger and water crisis: Droughts and shrinking glaciers has resulted in an increased water scarcity. However, this has also created a food shortage as it is harder to produce good quality food. People have had to limit the quantity and the variety of the food they eat which is leading to a hunger crisis, especially in least developing countries.</li>
    <li>Ocean acidification: Carbon dioxide dissolves in the ocean forming carbonic acid. This is harming marine life. Due to the large amounts of carbon pollution, the ocean has absorbed around 29% if this additional carbon and the ocean's water is now 30% more acidic compared to the beginning of the industrical era.</li>
    <li>Economic implications of dealing with climate change: Extreme weather conditions and sea levels rising could cause damage to physical assets, for example, real estate and infrastructure. However, the industry most at risk from climate change is agriculture. Extreme rainfall and melting snow has meant that flooding is more prone to happen. Flooding, increased heat and drought due to climate change decreases crop yields.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What can be done to prevent climate change at home?</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Cut back on flying</li>
    <li>Walk, cycle, take public transport</li>
    <li>Electric vehicles: scooter, car</li>
    <li>Throw away less food</li>
    <li>Recycle</li>
    <li>Change your source of energy, e.g. wind power, solar panels</li>
    <li>Eat less meat and dairy and try a more plant-based diet</li>
